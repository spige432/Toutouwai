Create a txt document for the samples from each individual population
```
bcftools query -l recode.renamed.vcf | grep "TA" > popTA.txt

```
Use vcftools to do pairwise fst between two populaitons. The log shows the Fst values.
```
vcftools --vcf recode.renamed.vcf --weir-fst-pop popTA.txt --weir-fst-pop popTM.txt --out TAvsTM

A snpashot of what the Fst values are looking like. The two natural island populations are the ones with the highest values, meaning that the allele frequencies of TMvsX are more different. The allele frequencies are most similar with TM vs Tﾄ『haranui because Tﾄ『haranui was founded with birds from TM. 

It's interesting that Rotokare is the one most different than Hauturu, but maybe it has something to do with how Rotokare was an extremely small natural mainland population. Also it has previously been supplemented with another population so that must have mixed the gene pool up a bit? For this study, Rotokare was supplemented with toutouwai from Bushy Park. This may have not been the best translocation because the Fst between those two locations is quite low at 0.052, meaning that they are more similar than other populations.

Should I have used the weighted Fst isntead of the mean?
